You can collect more contribution statistics from the git history with [git-stats](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats) for instance, using in that case `git stats --authors`

Github also provide a [contributors graph](https://github.com/ULHPC/ulhpc-docs/graphs/contributors) which seems to display broken statistics, probably due to the public repository release (from the internal gitlab instance toward the present [github](https://github.com/ULHPC/ulhpc-docs) repository) operated by S. Varrette (at the origin of this project) before leaving the University of Luxembour on Aug 31, 2022).
