# HPC @ Uni.lu: A chronological overview

With the advent of the technological revolution and the digital transformation that made all scientific disciplines becoming computational nowadays, High-Performance Computing (HPC) is increasingly identified as a strategic asset and enabler to accelerate the research performed in all areas requiring intensive computing and large-scale Big Data analytic capabilities.
The University of Luxembourg (UL) operates since 2007 a large academic HPC facility that remains the reference implementation within the country, offering a cutting-edge research infrastructure to Luxembourg public research while serving as edge access to the Euro-HPC Luxembourg supercomputer operated by [LuxProvide](http://www.lxp.lu).
Special focus was laid on the development of large computing power combined with huge data storage capacity to accelerate the research performed in intensive computing and large-scale data analytic (Big Data).
This was made possible through an ambitious funding strategy enabled from the early stage of the HPC developments, which was supported at the rectorate level to establish the HPC strategy as transversal to all research domains.

The historically first production system installed in 2007 has been [Chaos](https://hpc.uni.lu/systems/chaos/) with a final theoretical peak performance of 14.5 TFlop/s.
[Gaia](https://hpc.uni.lu/systems/gaia/) was then launched in 2011 as a replacement to reach a theoretical peak performance of 145.5 TFlops. It was the first computing cluster introducing GPU accelerators to our users.
Both systems were kept running until their decommissioning in 2019.

Current, [Iris](iris/index.md) and [Aion](aion/index.md) are our production systems sharing the same High Performance Storage solutions, when __[Aion](aion/index.md) is our flagship supercomputer__ until 2024.

We maintain (or used to maintain) several experimental systems in parallel.

## Capacity evolution

The below figures illustrates the evolution of the computing and storage capacity of the ULHPC facility over the last 5 years.

## Usage

The below figure outline the cumulative usage (in CPU Years) of the production clusters within the ULHPC facility for the time period 2015-2019.

* During their lifetime, [Gaia](https://hpc.uni.lu/systems/gaia/) and [Chaos](https://hpc.uni.lu/systems/chaos/) processed respectively **4.5 million and 1.7 million jobs**, cumulating **13835 Years of CPU Time usage**.

## Naming conventions

Our clusters and supercomputers are named from [Greek primordial deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_primordial_deities) or [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology) while keeping a name as short as possible.

* [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(cosmogony)#Greco-Roman_tradition) was, according to Hesiod's Theogony, the first thing to exist and thus looked as appropriate.  "_Hesiod's Chaos has been interpreted as either "the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity_"
* [gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia) is the personification of the Earth and the ancestral mother of all life. It sounded pertinent for our first system installed in Belval to serve the growing life-science community and the newly created LCSB system bio-medicine Interdiciplinary center.
* [iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)) is the personification and goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods.
* [aion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aion_(deity)) is a Hellenistic deity associated with time, the orb or circle encompassing the universe, and the zodiac.
