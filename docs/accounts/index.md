# Get an Account

In order to use the ULHPC facilities, you need to have a user account with an associated user login name (also called username) placed under an account hierarchy.

## Conditions of acceptance

### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

{%
   include-markdown "../policies/aup.md"
   start="<!--intro-start-->"
   end="<!--intro-end-->"
%}

Remember that **you are expected to acknowledge ULHPC in your publications**.

??? warning "ULHPC Platforms are meant for R&D!"
    Note that the ULHPC facility is made for Research and Development and it is **NOT** a full production computing center -- for such needs, consider using the [national HPC center](https://luxprovide.lu).

    In particular, we cannot make any guarantees of cluster availability or timely job completion even if we target a minimum compute node availability above 95% which is typically met - for instance, past KPI statistics in 2019 report a computing node availability above 97%.

### General conditions for UL staff

As soon as you belong to the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu) and that you accept to conform to the IT rules of the university as well as the [UL HPC Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)](https://hpc.uni.lu/download/documents/Uni.lu-HPC-Facilities_Acceptable-Use-Policy_v2.0.pdf), you are eligible for having an HPC account.

??? warning "UL HPC $\neq$ University credentials"
    Be aware that the source of authentication for the HPC services (**including [gitlab.uni.lu](https://gitlab.uni.lu)**), based on [RedHat IdM/IPA](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/linux_domain_identity_authentication_and_policy_guide/index) **DIFFERS** from the University credentials (based on UL Active Directory).

## FAQ

### Can I share an account? â€“ Account Security Policies


!!! danger
    The sharing of passwords or login credentials is **not allowed** under UL HPC and University information security policies. Please bear in mind that this policy also protects the end-user.

Sharing credentials removes the ability to audit and accountability for the account holder in case of account misuse. Accounts which are in violation of this policy may be disabled or otherwise limited. Accounts knowingly skirting this policy may be banned.

If you find that you need to share resources among multiple individuals, shared [projects](accounts/projects.md) are just the way to go, and remember that the University extends access to its HPC resources (_i.e._, facility and expert HPC consultants) to the scientific staff of national public organizations and external partners for the duration of joint research projects under the conditions defined above.

When in doubt, please [contact us](contact.md) and we will be happy to assist you with finding a safe and secure way to do so.
