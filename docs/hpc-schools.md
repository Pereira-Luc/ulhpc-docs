# On-site HPC trainings and tutorials

We propose periodical on-site events for our users. They are free of charge and can be attended by anyone from the University of Luxembourg faculties and interdisciplinary centers. 
Additionally, we also accept users from LIST, LISER and LIH. If you are part of another public research center, please [contact us](mailto:hpc-school-for-beginners@uni.lu).

## Next events 

- Introduction to Numerical Linraries with BLAS - Jan. 2024, 29th 09h00-13h00, 1.010 MNO - Belval campus
- Large Language Model on HPC - Jan. 2024, 29th at 15h00-17h00, 2.380 MSA - Belval campus

## HPC School for beginners

This event aims to equip you with essential skills and knowledge to embark on your High-Performance Computing journey. The event is organized monthly and is composed of two half days (usually 9am-12pm).

Next planned sessions:

- Dec. 2023, 11th and 12th, MSA - Belval campus - CB-MAI-SAVOIR 4.010
- Jan. 2024, 15th and 16th, MNO - Belval campus - CB-MAI-NOMBRE 1.020

Feel free to only attend the second day session if:

- You can connect to the ULHPC
- You are confortable with the command line interface

Limited spots available (usually 30 max). Please register by [emailing us](mailto:hpc-school-for-beginners@uni.lu)

### Morning 1 - Accessing the Cluster and Command Line Introduction 
Learn how to access the HPC cluster, set up your machine, and navigate the command line interface effectively. Gain confidence in interacting with the cluster environment.

### Morning 2 - Understanding HPC Workflow: Job Submission and Monitoring
Explore the inner workings of HPC systems. Discover the process of submitting and managing computational tasks. Learn how to monitor and optimize job performance.


## Python HPC School

In this workshop, we will explore the process of improving Python code for efficient execution. Chances are, you 're already familiar with Python and Numpy. However, we will start by mastering profiling and efficient NumPy usage as these are crucial steps before venturing into parallelization. Once your code is fine-tuned with Numpy we will explore the utilization of Python's parallel libraries to unlock the potential of using multiple CPU cores. By the end, you will be well equipped to harness Python's potential for high-performance tasks on the HPC infrastructure. 

### Target Audience Description 
The workshop is designed for individuals who are interested in advancing their skills and knowledge in Python-based scientific and data computing. The ideal participants would typically possess basic to intermediate Python and Numpy skills, along with some familiarity with parallel programming. This workshop will give a good starting point to leverage the usage of the HPC computing power to speed up your Python programs. 

### Next planned sessions

## Conda environment management for Python and R

The creation of Conda environments is supported in the University of Luxembourg HPC systems. But when Conda environments are needed and what tools are available to create Conda environments? Attend this tutorial if your projects involve R or Python and you need support with installing packages.

The topics that will be covered include:

- how to install packages using the facilities available in R and Python,
- how to document and exchange environment setups,
- when a Conda environment is required for a project, and
- what tools are available for the creation of Conda environments.

### Next planned session

- Dec. 2023, 18th 10:00 - 12:00, MSA - Belval campus - CB-MAI-SAVOIR 2.240
